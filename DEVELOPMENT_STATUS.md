## üìù Notes

### Decisions Made
1. Using NextAuth v5 instead of Clerk for cost
2. SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
3. Server Components by default, Client Components when needed
4. Tailwind CSS instead of component library
5. API routes instead of Server Actions (for now)

### Lessons Learned
1. NextAuth v5 has breaking changes from v4
2. TypeScript strict mode helps catch bugs
3. Seed data essential for development
4. Empty states improve UX significantly

### Future Considerations
1. Consider moving to Server Actions
2. Evaluate need for state management (Redux/Zustand)
3. Consider GraphQL for complex queries
4. Evaluate microservices architecture
5. Consider event-driven architecture
